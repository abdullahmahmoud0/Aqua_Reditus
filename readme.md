# Aqua Reditus 
*A Compact, Smart Wastewater Recycling System for Urban Homes*

---

## Overview

**Aqua Reditus** is a modular and smart wastewater recycling system designed to fit into compact spaces and recycle greywater for non-potable uses like toilet flushing and irrigation. It uses a combination of physical filtration, activated carbon, UV sterilization, and IoT sensors to monitor water quality and performance.

## Why I Made This Project

In urban households, greywater from showers and sinks is wasted daily. I wanted to design a system that empowers individuals to treat and reuse this water, reducing water consumption, especially in water-scarce regions.
