**Total Time Spent: 60 hours**

## Day 1: Ideation & Objective Definition  
**Date:** *26/6*  
**Time Spent:** 6 hours  

The idea for Aqua Reditus came to me after noticing how much greywater is wasted in everyday activities — from washing vegetables to rinsing dishes. I began thinking about ways to **recover and treat this water** on a small, personal scale. I wanted the system to be compact, easy to understand, and fully modular, so that each stage of treatment could be observed and studied individually.  

I spent several hours drafting the initial concept, imagining a multi-stage treatment process where each chamber would handle a specific type of purification: sedimentation for large debris, filtration for finer particles, activated carbon for chemical impurities, and UV disinfection for microbial safety. I also sketched preliminary flow diagrams, constantly asking myself, *If I were using this at home, how would it operate intuitively?*

## Day 2–3: Research on Filtration Stages  
**Date:** *27/6–28/6*  
**Time Spent:** 10 hours  

The next two days were devoted entirely to research. I studied multiple examples of compact wastewater treatment systems used in both urban and rural contexts, focusing on **effective multi-stage filtration methods**. I read about sedimentation efficiency, particle capture in sand and gravel layers, activated carbon absorption rates, and UV exposure times for microbial inactivation.  

I realized that proper sequencing and flow management are critical. For instance, if sedimentation isn’t efficient, downstream filters would clog quickly. I also explored how different chemicals or media might interact with greywater contaminants. By the end of these days, I had refined my treatment path:
1. Gravel and sand filtration for mechanical removal.  
2. Activated carbon absorption for chemical contaminants.  
3. Fine mesh filtration for final polishing.  
4. UV disinfection for microbial safety.  

I documented expected performance metrics and simulated the flow patterns conceptually to make sure each stage could handle realistic household greywater volumes.

## Day 4–6: Design of the Modular System  
**Date:** *29/6–1/7*  
**Time Spent:** 15 hours  

Once the concept was solid, I focused on designing the **modular structure** of the system. I worked on chamber arrangements, flow pathways, and the accessibility of each section. A major priority was that each chamber could be “removed” conceptually for maintenance or inspection, without disrupting the rest of the system.  

I imagined the user experience in detail: sliding out the sedimentation chamber to empty it, swapping carbon cartridges easily, and having visible markers to indicate flow direction. I also paid attention to the **spatial relationships** between chambers so that water would naturally move from one stage to the next without requiring external pumping in the simulated model.  

The system design became more than just functional; it was a **learning tool**, illustrating the logic of water purification in an intuitive way.

## Day 7–8: Conceptual Simulation and Flow Analysis  
**Date:** *2/7–3/7*  
**Time Spent:** 10 hours  

I simulated water flow and treatment efficiency using conceptual models and calculations. I focused on flow rates, contact times, and the relative effectiveness of each stage. For example, I examined how much time water should remain in the carbon chamber to reduce chemical content effectively, or how long UV exposure would need to be to inactivate typical microbes.  

During these days, I also created theoretical plots showing how **turbidity**, **pH**, and **contaminant levels** would change across each stage. Imagining the system in action was surprisingly satisfying — I could see the water gradually becoming cleaner, even though this existed only in simulations and calculations.

## Day 9–10: Documentation and Expected Results  
**Date:** *4/7–5/7*  
**Time Spent:** 11 hours  

I finalized all design documentation and created expected outcome graphs for the system. These included:
- **TDS reduction** through sedimentation, filtration, and carbon absorption.  
- **pH stabilization** after treatment.  
- **Turbidity reduction**, illustrating the clarity improvement from start to finish.

The documentation included clear annotations of chamber function, expected performance, and conceptual flow diagrams. I also prepared a detailed **Bill of Materials** with all hypothetical components and their simulated purpose.

## Final Touches and Reflection  
**Date:** *6/7*  
**Time Spent:** 8 hours  

The last day was for polishing the journal and repository. I reviewed every diagram, calculation, and image to ensure it told the full story of Aqua Reditus as a **conceptual and a Me project**.  

Looking back, this project felt like more than an academic exercise — it was a journey of exploration. I learned not only about water treatment but also about **design thinking**, how to visualize complex processes, and how to anticipate problems before they happen. Aqua Reditus may exist only in simulations and models, but it represents a personal vision of sustainable water reuse that I hope to explore further in the future.
